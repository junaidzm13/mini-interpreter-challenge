# [mini-interpreter-challenge](https://gitlab.com/junaidzm13/lisp-language-parser-challenge)

This is one of the challenges I developed for my company's campus recruitment hackathon. It's built using `Kotlin`, `SpringBoot`, `GitLab CI` and `JUnit` (for automated testing). On top, I used `Scala` to develop my own solution for this challenge (can find it inside `ex-gen`, short for expression generator).

Students had a positive feedback for this, since it forced them to think outside of their usual imperative programming approach.
